Space analysis is an open-source project dedicated to the analysis and visualization of astronomical data. This repository provides tools and resources for exploring, processing, and visualizing data from various astronomical sources and gain deeper insights into the cosmos

## Star data features

### Absolute Temperature (in K):

The temperature of stars measured in Kelvin. Absolute temperature is a fundamental characteristic that influences other properties such as luminosity and spectral class.

### Relative Luminosity (L/Lo):

The luminosity of a star relative to the Sun's luminosity (Lo = 3.828 x 10^26 Watts). This feature indicates how bright a star is compared to our Sun.

### Relative Radius (R/Ro):

The radius of a star relative to the Sun's radius (Ro = 6.9551 x 10^8 meters). It provides insight into the size of a star in comparison to the Sun.

### Absolute Magnitude (Mv):

A measure of a star's brightness as seen from a standard distance. Absolute magnitude is crucial for understanding a star's true luminosity.

### Star Color:

The color of the star, which typically correlates with its temperature and spectral class. Star color is an important visual characteristic used to classify stars.

### Spectral Class:

A classification based on a star's spectrum, indicating its temperature and other properties. Common spectral classes include O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, with O being the hottest and M being the coolest.

### Star Type (Target classes):

The type of star, serving as the target variable for classification tasks. Star types include different categories such as main sequence stars, giants, supergiants, and white dwarfs.
